# Unit 3: UML
## Description

In Unit 3, I delved into the Unified Modeling Language (UML), a standardized language for visualizing software systems before implementing them. This unit introduced me to the major UML models used throughout object-oriented analysis, design, and development processes. I explored how to design various UML diagrams, such as class, activity, state, sequence, and use case diagrams, to represent different aspects of software systems. By the end, I was able to recognize the difference between types of UML models, understand when each of them are applicable at different stages of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), and create my own UML models to visualise different aspects of a software system.
