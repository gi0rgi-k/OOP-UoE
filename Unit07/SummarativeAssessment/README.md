## Description

### Grade: Merit


I've thoroughly reviewed your design document for the software supporting a self-driving car, and I appreciate the effort you've put into your research and presentation. Here's some constructive  feedback to further enhance your work:

1.	Introduction: Your introduction effectively discusses the concept of autonomous vehicles (AVs) and their benefits, such as improvements in road safety, efficiency, and environmental impact. It's commendable that you've highlighted the role of sensors and machine learning algorithms in AVs for environmental sensing, navigation, and decision-making. 

2.	Design Overview: Your report describes the design of a Level 4 autonomous vehicle capable of automatically driving, detecting obstacles, and adjusting speed and route. Using object-oriented programming in Python, you've outlined three main operations: Obstacle Detection, Navigation and Route Planning, and a User Interaction system. It's clear that you've given careful consideration to the specific classes needed to manage sensor data processing, obstacle identification, route planning, and user interactions.

3.	Use Case Diagram: Ensure that all essential use cases are included in the diagram. It's important to cover functionalities like starting the car, reducing speed, and changing routes. Clarify which functionalities are considered separate use cases for better understanding.

4.	Class Diagram: While your class diagram outlines important classes, pay attention to the hierarchy and relationships between them. This will enhance clarity and accuracy in depicting the structure of your software design. Please consider defining each required class.

5.	Activity Diagram: The activity diagrams for Navigation & Route Planning and Obstacle Detection need refinement. Ensure they accurately represent the flow of activities within a specific use case to provide clearer insights into the system's behavior.

6.	Sequence Diagram: The purpose of the sequence diagram for the user interface isn't clear. Consider renaming it to reflect its purpose more accurately and align it with a specific use case. Also, ensure completeness and clarity in representing the system's states.

7.	Data Structure Choice: It's important to explicitly mention the rationale behind your choice of data structures, such as lists and dictionaries, within the software design. This will provide insight into your decision-making process. In the presented report the data structure are not clearly mentioned in the classes.

Overall, your work shows promise, and with these refinements, your design document will be even more comprehensive and aligned with best practices in software design. Keep up the good work, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need further assistance or clarification.
