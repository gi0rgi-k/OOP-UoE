# Unit 7: Debugging / Error Handling, Data Structures and Data Search
## Description

In Unit 7, I learned more about debugging, error handling, data structures, and data search techniques in Python. This unit highlighted various types of errors that can occur in a program. I also improved my understanding of data structures, such as lists, dictionaries, and sets, which are useful for organizing data efficiently. The ePortfolio exercises also helped me to gain practical knowledge in implementing these data structures in Python. The readingss such as "Driverless Car: Software Modelling and Design using Python and Tensorflow" by Reddy and "Metamorphic testing of driverless cars" by Zhou and Sun, provided valuable insights into the application of these concepts in real-world scenarios. For the Summarative Assessment I applied the planning, software design, UML visualisation and data structure knowledge in practice. Overall, this unit equipped me with essential skills to design and plan for implementation of an application.



## Tasks

### e-Portfolio Activities

+ ePortfolio_unit_7.pdf - Review the ways in which data structures support object-oriented development. With examples of three different data structures
+ ePortfolio_unit_7.pdf - Create a nested dictionary of data on cars within a Car class. Extend the program to work with the dictionary by calling the following methods: items(), keys(), values()
+ ePortfolio_unit_7.pdf - Develop a program which allows a user to enter the properties which they require of a design pattern, and have the program make a recommendation

### Summarative Assessment

+ System Design of a Drivereless Car
