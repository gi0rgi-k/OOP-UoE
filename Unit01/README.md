# Unit 1: An Introduction to Python Programming and the OO Programming Paradigm
## Description

In Unit 1, I started my journey into Python and the object-oriented programming (OOP) approach. I learned about the evolution of programming languages towards OOP, understood how this paradigm handles the complexities of software development. Through this unit, I learned the foundational elements of OOP, including abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, which are essential for building scalable applications and softwares with OOP framework. I also gained coding experience by defining Python classes with different types of attributes (e.g. protected & unprotected) and methods, I assigned various data types to variables, and used appropriate access modifiers. The readings and exercises provided a good foundation to these concepts, enabling me to describe the key features of OOP and apply them in Python programming. This unit laid the groundwork for more advanced topics in the upcoming weeks.
