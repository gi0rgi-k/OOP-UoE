# Unit 6: Abstract Methods and Interfaces
## Description

In Unit 6, I improved my understanding of Python's object-oriented programming by focusing on abstract methods and interfaces. Through the exercises, I learned how to use abstract classes and interfaces to structure Python programs, allowing me for more flexible and scalable code design. I learned the benefits of using interfaces, such as promoting code reusability and the implementation of multiple inheritance. I also gained insights into the metrics used to evaluate the effectiveness of object-oriented programs, such as cohesion, coupling, and maintainability.
