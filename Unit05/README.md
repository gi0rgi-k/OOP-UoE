# Unit 5: More on Classes
## Description

In Unit 5, I deepened my understanding of Python classes, focusing on the assignment of variable values using constructors and the use of abstract classes for inheritance. This unit focused on the modularity of object-oriented code and explored how inheritance can be implemented through polymorphism, aggregation, and composition. I learned about the important role of packages and namespaces in variable naming to avoid conflicts in code. By the end of this unit, I was able to create Python programs utilizing constructors and abstract classes, describe the concepts of polymorphism, aggregation, and composition, and effectively name variables within their respective namespaces.
