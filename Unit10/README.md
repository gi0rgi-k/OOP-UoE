# Unit 10: Testing Code in Practice
## Description

In Unit 10, I focused on the practical aspects of testing and packaging Python code to ensure its deployment readiness. This unit emphasized the importance of applying unit tests to verify the functionality of the code, utilizing tools like Pylint to check for stylistic adherence, and documenting code effectively. Inline commenting and comprehensive documentation were also key components of this unit. The readings provided deeper insights into best practices for Python development, the significance of maintaining coding standards, and the role of documentation in software quality.
