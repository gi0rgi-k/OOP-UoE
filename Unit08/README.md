# Unit 8: Data Structures and Data Search in Practice
## Description

In Unit 8, I learned about the practical application of set operations and linear data search algorithms, and thought about their relevance to driverless car design. This included understanding union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference operations and how they can be applied to manage data efficiently. I also implemented linear search techniques, which are crucial for handling unsorted data. The practical exercises helped reinforce these concepts by allowing me to manipulate data structures and perform searches, essential for the summative code assessment. The readings provided additional insights into advanced data structures, algorithm design, and best practices in Python. For the collaborative discussion, I learned about strengths and weaknesses of designing a metamodel to support object-oriented (OO) design for the Internet of Things (IoT).
