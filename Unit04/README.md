# Unit 4: Applying a UML Model to a Program Implementation: UML in Practice

## Description

In Unit 4, I extended my unerstanding of UML by experimenting with additional models, particularly activity and class diagrams. This unit focused on the practical application of UML in software development, teaching me how to prepare class diagrams that correspond to systems intended for implementation. I also started learning how to write Python programs based on the UML diagrams which is an essential skill for the upcoming summative assessments in next units.
