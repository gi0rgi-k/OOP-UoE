# Unit 2: Object Oriented Analysis - Initial Steps towards Programming in Python
## Description

In Unit 2, I improved my understanding object-oriented approach and made some advancements in Python programming. I learned how use case diagrams are used for communication during the software development cycle and learned about system behaviors using state machine diagrams. In this module, I gained knowledge of UML and its application in software development which is a crucial part of object-oriented design, which then helps with the actual software implementation. I used Python to create programs with classes with instance and class methods, and fixed a commoon code bug such as mutable default arguments.
