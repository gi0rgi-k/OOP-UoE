### Grade: Merit

Thank you for submitting the assignment, is your mark based on your submitted assignment. However you only submitted a word file, you did not submit the code.

 (Knowledge and Understanding weighted at 30%).   = 19/30

You've demonstrated a good grasp of Python's Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) features in your software design, incorporating classes like Object Detection and Navigation Control. While you provided a screenshot of the commented code, it is not easy to follow. Nonetheless, your code showcases encapsulation and abstraction. However, it appears that the chosen classes primarily handle fundamental tasks related to setting and retrieving class data, and the explicit implementation of other OOP concepts, such as inheritance, is not immediately evident in the code.

 

Test data used to test the code. (Application of Knowledge and understanding weighted a 30%). 18/30

 

You've included dedicated testing classes for your project, attempting unit testing, but the provided screenshot of the test class does not provide evidence of unit testing using functions like assertInstance. Additionally, no explicit test data is visible in the screenshot, with hardcoded test data to validate each class's functionality. Based on this description, it seems that the provided information may not entirely validate the test data.

Structure and Presentation (weighted at 30%) 20

Your code demonstrates few  comments contributing to the understanding of the logical flow. However, it's noteworthy that not the entire code is commented. For instance, it could be beneficial to provide comments for class definitions, elucidating the purpose of each class.
