# Unit 11: Pointers, References & Memory, and Design Patterns
## Description

In Unit 11, I focused on implementing and testing the driverless car code based on the requirements from Unit 7. The implementation required creating and testing scripts based on UML diagrams, ensuring that the final product met design specifications and was thoroughly documented. This exercise reinforced the importance of using Python's object-oriented features and adhering to best practices in code documentation and testing - writing unit tests and using assert statements to verify code functionality were crucial components. From this unit's readings, I learned about Python's efficciency and sustainable coding practices.
